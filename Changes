Revision history for Data-Unixish-Implementation

1.20    2012-07-21 (SHARYANTO)

        No functional changes. Rename distribution from
        Data-Unixish-Implementation to Data-Unixish, since the specification is
        now renamed to Unixish. Bump version number to work around PAUSE
        restriction.
